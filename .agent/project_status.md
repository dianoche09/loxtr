# Project Status: LOXTR Global Customs AI

## Core Mission
Building a **Global Customs Operating System**. COUNTRY-AGNOSTIC. Not a Turkey-focused marketplace. Not just a logistics tool. A professional authority for Digital Customs Audits, HS Code Verification, and Tariff Radar.

## Completed Milestones (LoxConvert)
1.  **Sovereign Identity:** Restored the premium "Understand" Hero with bold typography and yellow rotate backgrounds.
2.  **Dashboard Architecture:** Reorganized intelligence into the "Audit Quad": Incoterms, Tariff & Duty, Document Integrity, and Destination Radar.
3.  **Horizontal Upload Node:** Redesigned the upload area to be wide and slim (non-bulky) and renamed to "Digital Customs Audit".
4.  **Shipment Matrix:** Implemented expandable file rows showing full line-item extraction (HS Code, Tax DNA, AI Logic).
5.  **Gated Intelligence:** Locked granular data (line items/suggested buyers) for non-members to drive registration.
6.  **Country-Agnostic Logic:** Removed "Turkey" bias. AI now extracts destination from docs and calculates taxes accordingly.
7.  **Unified Authentication:** Redirected all auth actions to central `loxtr.com` with a `redirectTo` loop to ensure users return back to the tool after login/register.
8.  **Minimalist Dashboard (v2):** Transformed the bulky UI into a clean, 'Operations Bar' based interface.
9.  **UI Scaling Optimization:** Systematically reduced font sizes, paddings, and border radii (removing the 'gigantic' feel). Standardized professional typography and high-density layouts. Removed authentication lock for line-item visibility.
10. **Shipment Dossier System:** Refactored the architecture to support multi-file uploads (Invoice, packing list, BL). Implemented a cross-check engine for quantity/weight validation and consolidated master exports.

## Current System State
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Vercel) + Gemini Pro Vision.
- **Database/Vault:** Supabase.
- **Bot:** Python Playwright (LinkedIn outreach).

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor Vercel build status.
- [ ] Refine "Global Export Engine" templates if requested.
- [ ] Expand LinkedIn outreach logic for "Global Customs" lead targeting.
